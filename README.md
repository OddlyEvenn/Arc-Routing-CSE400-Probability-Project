# üß† Probability Project: Randomized Arc Routing with Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Short Description:**  
A probability-based solution to the Arc Routing Problem using Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm. Incorporates traffic simulation with Poisson distribution and randomization in path selection. Includes basic, randomized, and multi-node versions to show the impact of congestion on shortest paths.

## üìå About the Project

This project addresses the **Arc Routing Problem (ARP)** under real-world traffic conditions using **probabilistic modeling** and **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm**. Each road segment‚Äôs traffic is simulated using the **Poisson distribution**, and a **congestion factor (Œ±)** is applied to dynamically adjust travel times.

The primary goal is to explore how **randomization** impacts routing decisions, especially when multiple shortest paths exist. This models real-world behavior where decisions are affected by uncertainty and variable traffic.
