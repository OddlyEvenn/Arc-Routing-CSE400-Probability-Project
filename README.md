# Arc-Routing-CSE400-Probability-Project
A probability-based solution to the Arc Routing Problem using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm. Incorporates traffic simulation with Poisson distribution and randomization in path selection. Includes basic, randomized, and multi-node versions to show the impact of congestion on shortest paths.
